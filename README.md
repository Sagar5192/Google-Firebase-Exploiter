// Replace with your Firebase project configuration found in source page
var firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
    authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
    projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
    storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
    appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
};


Make sure to replace "your_api_key", "your_project_id", "your_messaging_sender_id", and "your_app_id" with the actual values from your Firebase project settings. 
These values are unique to your Firebase project and allow your web application to connect to Firebase services.

Once you've replaced the placeholders with the correct values, your JavaScript code will be properly configured to work with your Firebase project.

Find the "Live Server" extension in the visual studio and install.
